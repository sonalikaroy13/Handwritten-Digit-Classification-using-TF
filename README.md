# # Handwritten Digit Classification from images using Tensorflow and Keras
This is a neural network model built using Tensorflow library with Keras API to classify the images of handwritten digits as integral digits between 0-9.
This model is trained on a very popular MNIST dataset and it's giving us 96.06% accuracy on test data.
